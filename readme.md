# Postcard: Media Queries for Popular Devices

Last year we made a postcard to give to attendees at Internet Week NY. We really didn't want to make just-another-piece-of-marketing-collateral that would end up in the trash, so instead of just being all blah blah marketing-y, we figured we'd put something useful on one side!

Of course we weren't *quite* as smart as we'd thought, so we've redesigned the postcard â€” and this time it includes a link to this repository so you can **use** the code. Better, right?

## How To Use This Repository

Use these media queries as a starting point for your responsive design breakpoints. You could simply copy the code snippets below, but if you clone or download the entire repo you'll get a PDF of the postcard, as well as [this sample web page](http://gymnasium.github.io/RWD-postcard/) that demonstrates the breakpoints as well. 

Seriously, [check it out](http://gymnasium.github.io/RWD-postcard/)... it is very cool.

Remember, these are just four out of **many**. Good responsive designers will modify these breakpoints as needed!
